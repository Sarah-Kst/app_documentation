## About

Methods of generalized pairwise comparisons (GPC) form a recent literature that attempts at addressing a common concern for the analysis of randomized clinical trial data; while multiple outcomes of interest are typically measured on patients, traditional statistical investigation only concentrates on a ‘’primary’’ outcome. All other outcomes are then either only considered as of secondary importance, or not considered at all in the analysis.
GPC aims at circumventing this pattern; its objective is to bridge statistical soundness with clinical relevance by:

1. Incorporating inputs of patients and clinicians into the analysis,

2. Providing a statistical tool that remains appropriate for interpretation and communication of the analysis.
